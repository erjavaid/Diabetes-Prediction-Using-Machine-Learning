# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether a person is likely to develop diabetes based on health-related data. Using the PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset, the model is trained to identify patterns and risk factors such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, age, and insulin levels.
