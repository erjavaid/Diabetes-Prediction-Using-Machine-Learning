# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether a person is likely to develop diabetes based on health-related data. Using the PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset, the model is trained to identify patterns and risk factors such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, age, and insulin levels.

Key Components:
Dataset: PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset (from Kaggle or UCI repository)

Features: Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age

Target: Binary classification (0: Non-diabetic, 1: Diabetic)

Steps Involved:
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, normalize/scale data

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand distributions, correlations, and feature importance

Model Training: Algorithms like Logistic Regression

Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, 

Prediction: User inputs health data to get real-time prediction
